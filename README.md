# DSC--KARATE--CLUB

This project applies recursive spectral modularity partitioning to the Karate Club graph to uncover multiple communities and track how node importance changes after each split. The main hub and bridge nodes—especially the instructor and administrator—remain central throughout because they lie on many shortest paths and connect different parts of the network. Community structure shapes the metrics: interior nodes show high clustering but low betweenness, while boundary nodes display higher betweenness and more variation as communities separate.
